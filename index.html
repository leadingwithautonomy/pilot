      <h4>About the Course</h4>
       <p>The course is based on exciting new research about how leaders can use autonomy to significantly increase employee commitment and generate successful results. The research uncovered significant disparities between what employees are looking for from their managers, and what the managers are providing. Leading with Autonomy translates this research into practical guidelines you can use on the job.</p>
       <p>Learning will be experiential, with scenario-based activities focusing on the most frequent and realistic challenges you face as both managers and team leaders.</p>
       <p>You will receive extensive resource materials, including expert tips and techniques for applying your learning from the workshop to your job.</p>
      <h4>Course Outline</h4>
       <p>The program consists of four sessions, each approximately two hours in length, that enable you to avoid micromanagement “triggers” and focus on the specific leadership skills that foster autonomy.</p>
